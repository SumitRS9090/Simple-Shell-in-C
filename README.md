# Simple-Shell-in-C
This is a lightweight command-line shell implemented in C, designed to demonstrate the core concepts of how Unix-like shells operate. It supports a set of built-in commands (cd, help, and quit) and can execute external programs by creating child processes using fork() and replacing them with new programs using execvp().

Key features include:

Reading and parsing user input

Handling built-in commands

Launching external programs

Dynamic memory allocation for flexible input handling

A simple command loop for continuous interaction

This project is a great starting point for understanding process management, input handling, and the basics of shell behavior in C.
